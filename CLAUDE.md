Read the readme.
Always run go fmt, go vet, and run tests, before you're finished with a task.
Always update readme to be consistent after your code changes.
After any big change such as adding a lot of lines of code or importing a new library, recalculate the size (see Makefile) and update the readme.
Don't list Test Assets in the readme.
